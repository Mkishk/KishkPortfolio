          About Me
        </h2>
        <hr/>
        <p> My name is Mahmoud Kishk and I am a freshman at UNC Charlotte. This website contains a curation of my work throughout the Spring Semester of UWRT 1103 Class. Lately there have beem major discoveries of water on planets on our solar system and also discoveries of planets almost identical to Earth. Nasa has ramped up their research and this has lead me to believe that there maybe other life sustaining planets and intelligent life forms. Most of my writing will reflect on that central idea and I am pleased with the work I have done throughout the semester and hopefully you will be able to see that on my site. As we near the end of the semester, I am now able to declare my major as a Biology major and many of things I learned throughout this course will help me in my future courses and many other research papers that I will be writing in the future.

              <p><q>UWRT 1103 has taught me a lot about the writing process and how to express myself through writing.<br/>
                    At the beginning of the semester, I thought that all formal writing had to be the common introduction, three body paragraphs and then a conclusion but after this course, I have learned that this is not necessary. I learned that you can express your writing through many different mediums to make it interesting for the reader. 
                    This class has really helped me improve my writing and my methods of writing.</q></p>
