					<div class="meteor"><h4>My Animation (Watch in fullScreen) </h4></div> <br>
					 <video width="600" height="240" controls>
					 <source src="Life-Sustaining Planets.mp4" type="video/mp4">
					 </video>	
					
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Explain</h4></div>
						<p>The purpose of the transmedia was to have us create an element that would bring multi-modality to our EIP. No one would want to read through long text or a website with just a bunch of words. The transmedia allows us to display information in a entertaining and visually appealing way. </p>
					
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Critical Reflection</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageright" src="img/CriticalReflection.png" alt="Critical Reflection"></img>I decided that the best thing to add to my EIP for multi-modality would be an animation. In the animation, I described major discoveries and breakthroughs that NASA has found over the past few years that makes life in space a possibility. Th animation was made with space/galaxy themes and backgrounds to relate to the information that was being displayed. The animation is also about a minute and thirty seconds long to display the information.</p>
					<p>I enjoyed creating the animation. I have a lot of experience with creating animations. I wish I had adobe flash installed on my laptop so that I could have made it from scratch but without it I used an online animation creator. I used biteable.com and it was very easy to use. For anyone without animation experience, I would recommend using Biteable because they have quality animations and its free. Its the next best thing to creating it from scratch.</p>
					
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Composition Process</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageleft" src="img/composition.png" alt="Composition Process"></img>
						I first researched everything that I wanted to add. I looked up major discoveries and breakthroughs from NASA and after fidning them out, I researched more in depth on why they were important to the discovery of life on other planets. After the research, I typed out what I wanted to write in each scene, in order to keep it short and light on the reading but also detailed.</p>
						<p>After typing out everything that I wanted to add, I went to biteables and started a new project. i picked out all of the backgrounds and themes that I wanted to use. After selecting all of the scenes, I added all of the information to a separate scene to fit all of the information. The process was very easy and biteables was easy to use.</p>
					
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Rhetorical Knowledge</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageright" src="img/Rhetorical.png" alt="Rhetorical Knowledge"></img></p> <p>This assignment allowed me to display valuable information in my EIP in a different style. It allowed me to use a different sytle than the traditional format and allowed me to make something more interactive for the viewer.</p>
					<p>The transmedia assignment provided a great way to engage readers into the discussion of the topic and also explained some major discoveries and breakthroughs by NASA. I used bitables animation creator to be able to add the use of technology into my EIP and I feel that it turned out great. </p>
					
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Knowledge of conventions</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageleft" src="img/Knowledge.png" alt="Knowledge of conventions"></img></p> <p>This assignment allowed me to present my information in a different and unconventional way. An animation allowed me to add an engaging element to my EIP while also informing the audience in an entertaining matter. The animation was an important part of my EIP in order to add some multi-media and also display information in a new way.</p>
