					<div class="meteor"><h4>Explain</h4></div>
						<p>The purpose of the map was to have us begin thinking about our EIP and what direction we wanted to take it. Part of the EIP was the community aspect and this map helped us see how we could achieve that. The map was a great way to show how our EIP affects the community and it was very beneficial to the start of the project.</p>
					
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Critical Reflection</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageright" src="img/CriticalReflection.png" alt="Critical Reflection"></img>I chose to base my map in california because there are many NASA research sites and launch sites located in California. At first I had a lot of trouble deciding how I wanted to create the map and what I could add but then we had the EIP workshop and I was given a lot of great ideas. I decided I would break my map up into three categories: research centers, Launch sites, and Educational centers. I decided to do it like this because I wanted to see how the launch sites and research centers would affect local businesses. I found that many of the bussiness surrounding the launch sites were educational centers for kids and adults to learn about space.  </p>
					<p>I really enjoyed creating the map and it really got me thinking about how I wanted to do my EIP. The map was a great way to begin the project and a great way to visualize the community aspect. I never thought that a map would be a useful tool to display information on topic but this assignment proved otherwise. My favorite part about that map is that you can see the proximity of everything and really see how the introduction of these research centers really affected the community. </p>
					
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Composition Process</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageleft" src="img/composition.png" alt="Composition Process"></img>
						When first trying to create this map, I was stumped. I didnt know where I could place it because charlotte has nothing space related and I didnt know what to add. I then researched where a lot of space activites occured and found California to be a major site for resarch and launches. From there, I began to research what other space related businesses were located in California.</p>
						<p>After finding all of the businesses, I plotted them on the map and then wrote a description of each and why I added it. After plotting all of the points, I grouped them into their corresponding categories and then color-coded them. After completing all of this, I looked over the map to make sure I included everything and then the process was done.</p>
					
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Rhetorical Knowledge</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageright" src="img/Rhetorical.png" alt="Knowledge of conventions"></img></p> <p>Creating the map was something different that I have never done before. It was different than any of the writing I have done before because most of my writing prior to this </p>
					<p>The "genre" of the writing for the map was very informal and lenient. For the most part, the writing that was done was just to explain why I chose to implement that location into the map and give a brief description on what it was. The writing was very simple and a small part of the map but was still essential in the understanding of the map.</p>
