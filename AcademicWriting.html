					<div class="meteor"><h4>Explain</h4></div>
						<p>The purpose of this assignment was to have us begin thinking of what academic writing is. This composition had no real guidelines or restrictions. Our instructions were to write an Academic paper and that allowed us to decide what academic writing is. We wrote on a topic that we found interesting and decided what kind of essay we would write.</p>
					
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Critical Reflection</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageright" src="img/CriticalReflection.png" alt="Critical Reflection"></img>I chose to write my composition 1 on the possibility of life-sustaining planets other than Earth and intelligent life. I wrote my essay on what I thought academic writing was based on how I wrote essays in high school. I wrote the typical five paragraph essay with an intro, three body paragraphs and a conclusion. I chose this format because thats what how I thought academic writing was supposed to be written. I also stayed very formal throughout the entire composition and didnt include any first person pronouns. </p>
					<p>Knowing now what I know about academic writing, I would have written my composition one completely differently. I would have gave my opinion on what I thought on the situation and made it a little less formal. I also would have added multiple different sources that contribute to the paper but also keep interesting. Most of my sources were government studies and they can get pretty repetitive and boring to read through. I also would have added some pictures throughout the text to give the reader a break but also gain valuable information through a different source. </p>
					
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Composition Process</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageleft" src="img/composition.png" alt="Composition Process"></img>
						The process I went through when creating this essay was quite simple. First I researched the topic and found all the information I wanted to use. After seeing what information I had, I brainstormed how I would arrange all of the information. After gathering all of the information and brainstorming, I began to write my essay without any much prewriting. I first began to write the introduction but I didnt start with the hook. I wrote the entire introduction, and thesis and then I went back and wrote a fitting hook. </p>
						<p>After completing the introduction, I began to write the body paragraphs. I decided to back up my argument with three main points. I wrote my body paragraphs in the same order that they were mentioned in the thesis. I added all of the research I did into these body paragraphs and gave as much information as possible to try and prove that there may be life on another planet. After completing the body paragraphs I began to write my conclusion. My conclusion just summarized everything I wrote throughout the essay. After that I did a works cited for all of the resources I used and then I proofread the essay.</p>
					
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Knowledge of Conventions</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageright" src="img/knowledge.png" alt="Knowledge of conventions"></img></p> <p>For this assignment, we were told to create an academic composition that something that interested us. At the time, to me an academic composition was a five paragraph essay that was very formal and contained the use of multiple sources for information. At the time, I also that academic writing shouldnt contain any multi-media to display information so I didnt add any.</p>
					<p>The "genre" of academic writing, is supposed to be formal but can be a little lenient. When I was writing the composition, I thought that academic writing was supposed to be extremely formal and that is why I wrote it in that manner.</p>
					
					 
					 <div class="meteor"><h4>Critical Reading</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageleft" src="img/CriticalReading.png" alt="fish1"></img>
						When researching the topic, I read through many articles and government research papers in order to determine what information I would like to use in the composition. While reading through the information, I was able to determine what information would be beneficial to me in my research and what wouldnt.</p>
						<p>Since this was a academic essay many of the resources I read through were research papers and scholarly articles so that the information I used in my paper would be relevant. I chose scholarly genres so that my paper would be complete with facts and not just opinions. My citation page was also done in MLA style and is was where I cited all of the sources I used throughout my paper.</p>
