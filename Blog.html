					<div class="meteor"><h4>Learning Outcomes in My EIP</h4></div>
					<p>I was able to clearly show knowledge of conventions in my EIP through the use of multiple multi-media and multi-modal elements. For me to implement the learning outcomes I have to understand what each outcome is. </p>
					<p>I think I show critical reading through my research. From my research and implementing it into my EIP, I am able to display the critical reading learning outcome perfectly. I am also able to show the knowledge of conventions through the multiple different styles I use. From the informal opinions I give and the strict formal research, I show how to implement different writing styles throughout the EIP. Im not really sure how to show critical reflection into my EIP, im still tryiong to figure that out.</p>

					<div class="meteor"><h4>EIP Update</h4></div>
					<p>I feel like as of right now my EIP is moving along great and I feel like I am at a good spot. I wish I could work on it more but I have been very busy lately. I have begun creating my website. I tried to use sites like wix and weebly but I didnt really like how they were turning out so i decided to code it myself. I have had a lot of experience coding websites throughout highschool and I just feel that I can make a better website if i code it myself. Coding it myself allows for a better project but it is a lot more time consuming.</p>
					<p>I have finished my home page and the layout of how I want the rest of the pages to look. I am very pleased with how it is looking right now and feel that it is amazing. So far, I also decided to switch my portfolio off of padlet to a website I coded myself because I didnt like the organization on padlet and found it difficult to use.</p>

					<div class="meteor"><h4>Understanding Learning Outcomes - Rhetorical Knowledge</h4></div>
					<p>Rhetorical knowledge is the ability to identify and apply strategies across a range of texts and writing situations. To me, this means that the writer would be able to write all types of different literary works. Like knowing the difference and applying the conventions of formal versus informal. </p>
					<p>To understand this learning outcome, you have to be able to tell which writing style you need to apply to that certain situation. You must be able to adjust your techniques to the situation and be able to be versatile with your writing. Throughout the semester, we have had many different writing situations and used different writing styles. My EIP is more formal and uses a bunch of multimedia in order to make it interesting to the reader. While my blog posts are very informal and display a more relaxed tone.</p>
					<p>This learning outcome is very important to a writer so that you can be able to write in any given situation.</p>

					 <div class="meteor"><h4>Interactive NASA</h4></div>
					<p>When you first go to the website, there is a robot that talks to you and helps you navigate through the website. On the bottom there is a bar with all of the decades from 1960 to allow you to skip to whichever decade you want. This is a very cool and great way to have an interactive view of NASA's history. </p>
					<p>My favorite part was that in each decade, you could see the rocket and the technology available at the time. Also a real great touch is the background music that corresponds to each decade. This was a really interesting way to learn about NASA's history and I really enjoyed the website. I really enjoyed their future section because I know NASA will do great things in the future. Their concept of future colonies on other planets is really great and I cant wait to see what the future holds.</p>

					<div class="meteor"><h4>Build a Website</h4></div>
					<p>For my EIP and portfolio, I feel that a website would be the best option to use. I feel like with a website, I can portray more information from different sources better on a website. I also plan on creating an animation to add to the website to display some of the evidence in a more entertaining manner.</p>
					<p>A great source of information that I plan to add to my website is youtube videos. Youtube videos have a lot of information and they portray it in an easy to follow and entertaining way. The youtube videos would help to make the website more multi-modal. I also plan on adding many pictures to accompany the text so that its not extremely boring. I hope these additions will make it more interesting so its not just full of facts. </p>

					<div class="meteor"><h4>Genre Expectations</h4></div>
					<p>Genre influences our thoughts on any subject. Everything is categoried into genres, everyone knows which they like and which they dont. For instance, if we look at music as an example. Just by knowing the genre, we will judge whether we like it or not. If you always listen to hip hop and  R&B and then somone recommends a country song, you probably wouldnt bother to listen to it because you already know what to expect before listening to the song. </p>
					<p>This same concept can be used in literary works. We know what to expect when he here novel or research paper or article or a comic. We know that comics and novels are for entertainment but comics contain pictures, articles are for information and research papers are to learn a lot about a topic. Having genres allows us to know put a group of work together in the same category and allows the reader to have an idea of what they are about to read before they even read it.</p>

					<div class="meteor"><h4>Update</h4></div>
					<p>Over the past couple of weeks, we finished our proposal for our EIP, and I now have a better understanding of what an EIP is and what is required of us. The use of google maps was something new to me and I never thought that a map would be useful in displaying information but it helped me really tie in the community aspect of the project. I am going to be basing my project in California, because there are major research centers and launch sites based in California. These really affect the community in California, many of the bussines's and local areas are influenced by the space research. </p>
					<p>Also in class, we watched a TED talks on how there are no original ideas anymore and that everything is a spin off of something else. This video, was very interesting to me and I really enjoyed because you never really think of stuff like that because the works are similar but they are not blatantly obvious. It made me think about some of my favorite movies, songs, and products how they were spin offs. I feel like there was original ideas at one point but in our current time, everything is just a spin off of something else.</p>

					<div class="meteor"><h4>What Iâ€™m Thinking About Right Now..in regard to my EIP</h4></div>
					<p></img>Right now, in my EIP, I have finally selected what topic I want to write about. I chose to continue researching the topic I wrote about in composition one. I decided to continue to research the possibility of life sustaining planets other than Earth and the possibility of other intelligent life forms.My main focus on my EIP is the contributions of NASA and Space X in order to find intelligent life on another planet.</p>
					<p>So far, in my research I have seen major breakthroughs that we are discovering daily in order to find intelligent life and life-sustaining planets. The main topics that I will focus on is the finding of water on Mars, the ability of astronauts to grow plants in space and the multiple earth-like replicas that have been found in other solar systems. These have been amazing finds by scientists working at NASA and began the development of the Mars mission. NASA hopes to have astronauts on Mars by 2030 to see if it is capable of hosting life. </p>

					 <div class="meteor"><h4>Citation By Citation</h4></div>
					<p>I was confused throughout the entire article by her use of scholarship, I wasnt sure what she was trying to say every time she brought it up. The point of the article is to show how different fields can be interconnected and these different tools can be used to benefit the person conducting the research. <p>
						<p>"The results are meant to be accessible to users in any field, telling all kinds of stories about how researchers share knowledge."Good maps simplify and highlight," Mr. Bergstrom explains. When working with large data sets, he says, one critical question to ask is, "What are the important structures here?"" This article portrays how valuable the use of maps can be to your research.</p>
						<p>What I take from this article is that maps can be a very useful tool to display topics and research. A great map will be visually pleasing and highlight all important information.

					<div class="meteor"><h4>My Writing Process</h4></div>
					<p><img src="img/Writing Process.png" alt="writing process"></img></p>
					<p> My writing process is best shown in the mind map above.</p>
						<p>First, in my pre-writing, I brainstorm ideas in my head and decide on what I want to write and what information I want to add. Then after gathering my ideas together, I do some drafting. I write the first draft, formulate my argument and my supporting research.After completing the first draft, I proof read and edit everything for grammar, spelling and formatting errors. After proofreading, I submit the essay for grading.</p>

					<div class="meteor"><h4>Critical Reflection</h4></div>
					<p>Over the last two weeks, our main assignment was composition one. I chose to write my topic on the possibilty of life sustaining planets other than Earth and  the possibility of intelligent life on other planets. I did a lot of research through government websites and documents to find out a lot of information. Overall My first draft wasnt too hard but I still need to make some edits. I found a lot of information but I feel like I can incorporate it better in my essay. Also, after learning that it is alright to use first person pronouns, I feel like I should go back and make some edits on what my opnion is in certain parts of the essay. I also feel like I should change the format of the essay because I did the typical five paragraph essay because thats what I thought a essay should look like. I plan on rewriting some parts of the essay and also adding some more information that I have recently found that can help to strengthen the essay. </p>
					<p>We also had to formulate an assignment sheet for our extended inquiry project. I felt like there wasnt much direction on what we were supposed to do. It was very hard coming up with an assignment sheet for an assignment we didnt know much about. I found it very difficult trying to come up with that we should incorporate into the assignment sheet because we didnt really know what an EIP should be or should look like but we felt that it should be multi-modal. It would have been better if we were given an assignment sheet on what we needed so we could have begun working on the project right away instead of trying to formulate an assignment sheet on something we barely knew about.</p>

					<div class="meteor"><h4>Academic Writing</h4></div>
						<p>Irvin's article about academic writing gave a lot of great information about writing in college. The article highlighted some myths that I have been doing my whole life and I realize now that I dont need to write the essay like that. One of the myths that applied to me was the Five Paragraph Essay myth. All throughout highschool, we were told that our essays had to have an introduction with a thesis, 3 supporting body paragraphs and a conclusion. I thought that was just the way to write essays since I have been doing it for the last four years. I now realize that this format doesnt make a great essay and that any format I use will be fine as long as the content is good.</p>
						<p>Another myth that I could really relate to was the Never use "I" myth. In highschool, we were always told that in formal essays there should never be first person pronouns because your opinion shouldnt be a part of the essay. In 11th grade we wrote a research paper that took us the whole year and students were docked points if first person pronouns were present. After reading this article, I now know that there is no format or correct way to write an essay and that you should just write it to the best of your ability.</p>

					 <div class="meteor"><h4>What makes Inquiry Questions Unique?</h4></div>
						<p>An inquiry question is unique because its a question that doesnt have a direct answer and should be open to research. You should be able to find some answers to the question through research but it is still a difficult question to answer. What makes these questions unique is that, you really dont know the answer or it may have multiple answers. An inquiry question doesnt have a simple yes or no answer.</p>
						<p>Inquiry questions have a clear focus on what they are asking and make invoke different opinions. You may feel one way about the answer to the question but someone else may see it from a different perspective. This makes them really unique because the differing opinions can lead to discussion about the topic.</p>

				<div class="meteor"><h4>My Composition Process</h4></div>
					<p>When I am writing an essay, I dont really have a set process. Most of the time, I dont prewrite or brainstorm on paper beforehand. I will think about what I want to add and plan it out in my head before I actually start writing. When I start writing, I usually start at the beginning with the introduction, but I do the hook last. I will write the entire intro paragraph and thesis and then after completing that, I will start to think on what I should make my hook. Because to me the hook is one of those parts that can either make or break your essay. If you have a great hook that gets the reader interested from the beginning than they are more open-minded and attentive when reading through your essay, but if you have a terrible, dull, boring hook, it wont really get the reader excited about reading through your essay. I put a lot of effort into thinking of a good hook because I feel that it is an important part of the essay.</p>
					<p>After I write my hook and introduction, I will look at my thesis to see how I want to structure my body paragraphs. I will put the body paragraphs in the order they were written in thesis to keep everything in context and easy to follow. When Writing the body paragrahs, I look at all the information I have and see how I want to structure my body paragraphs. I will always write the transition sentence at the beginning of the next paragraph because I feel that it flows more smoothly that way. After finishing the body paragraphs, I will write my conclusion that summarizes everything I talked about. After that, I proofread to check for grammar or spelling errors. Then im done.<p>

					 <div class="meteor"><h4>Inquiry Magazine Response</h4></div>
						<p>I wasnt here on the first day of class because I signed up late but one thing I am interested in is space. Im not sure what was in the inquiry magazine but one question I always thought about and still await for the answer to this day is, is there aliens or other life sustaining planets?</p>
						<p>In the infinite galaxy and space, there must be at least one planet out there that can host life and have intelligent life forms. I hope that one day we could find that planet or they can find us. If there is other life out there, maybe one day we can interact with them if they are as advanced as us. Hopefully they are peaceful!	</p>
