					<div class="meteor"><h4>Critical Reflection</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageleft" src="img/CriticalReflection.png" alt="fish1"></img></p>
						<p>Creating the EIP was very difficult. I decided to code the website myself because I didnt like any of the templates that WIX or weebly offered. Creating the EIP was a big project and took a lot of time. It was very difficult to code but with I have had a lot of experience with HTML coding in the past. I coded the entire website and put a lot of effort into it and hope everyone will think it is as good as I do.</p>
						<p>The hardest part of coding the website myself, was getting everything in line and setting up the layout. Sometimes it was very difficult to get all of the information to fit in the correct spot on the website and got frustrating at some points. After creating the layout, I was able to fill in the information and give my spin on why I think it is important.</p>
						
					
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Critical Reading</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageright" src="img/CriticalReading.png" alt="fish1"></img</p>
					<p>When researching information for my project, I had to read through a bunch of NASA documents and research to obtain the information I need for my project. I was able to read the documents and decipher what I needed and what I didnt need to add to my website. The critical reading can also be seen throgh my take on the subject. It shows that I was able to read through the information, understand it and give my personal opinion on it.</p>
                     
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Composition Process</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageleft" src="img/composition.png" alt="fish1"></img></p>
						<p>I think the composition process can be mainly seen in my layout and how the website is set up. I give a different layout for the homepage that sets up the rest of the pages. The pages with information on them, all have the same layout and show my thought process on how I wanted to build the website and add information,</p>

					
					<div class="meteor"><h4>Knowledge of Conventions</h4></div>
					<p><img class="imageright" src="img/knowledge.png" alt="fish1"></img></p>
					<p>Throughout my Project you will see the different styles of writing. When i am giving serious and important information, I keep a very formal tone but when giving my opinion and putting things in my perspective, it is a informal tone so that my opinion can shine through. Also the youtube videos and pictures and picture captions all have a different tone that display different kinds of information in a more entertining way.</p>
